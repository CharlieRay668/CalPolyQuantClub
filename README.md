# GitHub Repository for Cal Poly Quant Club

## Getting Started

This repository contains the codebase for the Cal Poly Quant Club. In order to get started, you need to setup a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine to create virtual environments and to run this project.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python virtual environments**

    If you have not installed the `virtualenv` package yet, you can do so using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

    Use the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`.

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

    On MacOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install the project requirements**

    Use the following command to install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set up environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in your project root and populate it with the necessary environment variables. For more information about these variables, please contact Charlie Ray.

That's it! You have now set up your environment and are ready to run the project.
